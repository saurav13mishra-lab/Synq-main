## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory and add the following:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5001
   JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
   NODE_ENV=development

   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

4. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or for development with auto-restart (if nodemon is installed):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The backend should now be running on:

   ```
   http://localhost:5001
   ```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
